## Getting Started

### Placeholder variables

Change following variables with your own, for easy of use `{{variableName}}` is used to easily find them.

| Name          | Description                           | file      | example        |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------- | -------------- |
| `prismicRepo` | The repo name of your prismic project | `sm.json` | prismic-repo-1 |

Other important information that needs changing:

- Repository config in `package.json`: everything needed for your repository. Things like name, description and repository URL
- SEO in `next-seo.config.js`: this is the default SEO data, if not provided in prismic. If you do not like hard coding default data, remove this file. This includes the `og-image.jpg` in `/public`
- Theme in `theme.ts`: this contains the styled components theme you will be working with.
- Fonts in `_documents.tsx`: include the font you want in the `<Head>` tags
- Favicon stuff in `/public`: this includes the favicon icons and manifest.json

### Environment variables

Add following ENV variables to a file in the root names: `env.local`

| Name             | Description                  |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `GA_TRACKING_ID` | Google Analytics tracking ID |
